# Testcase Example:  '121'
#
# Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: x = 121
# Output: true
# Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: x = -121
# Output: false
# Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it
# becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: x = 10
# Output: false
# Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a
# palindrome.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
#
#
#
# Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
#

# @lc code=start
# @param {Integer} x
# @return {Boolean}
def is_palindrome(x)
  return false if x.negative?
  return false if x % 10 == 0 && x != 0

  reversed_number = 0

  while x > reversed_number
    reversed_number = reversed_number * 10 + x % 10
    x /= 10
  end

  x == reversed_number || x == reversed_number / 10
end
# @lc code=end
